# Governance & Maintenance

## Project Governance

Quieter.ai follows a **benevolent-dictator** model.

- Final decisions rest with the maintainer
- Design direction is intentionally opinionated
- There is no formal voting or roadmap process

---

## Contributions

Small, targeted contributions are welcome:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Clearly scoped enhancements

Large architectural changes should be discussed before submitting a PR.

The maintainer may decline contributions that:

- Expand scope beyond the project’s intent
- Increase maintenance burden disproportionately
- Introduce legal, security, or privacy ambiguity

---

## Support Expectations

- No guaranteed response times
- No real-time support channels
- Issues may be closed if out of scope or insufficiently specified

This is intentional and helps keep the project sustainable.
