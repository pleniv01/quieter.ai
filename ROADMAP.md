# Quieter.ai Roadmap

This document outlines the current direction and long-term vision for Quieter.ai.
It is not a commitment or promise, and priorities may change based on user needs,
contributor interest, and ongoing research.

# Who Are You

Contributions from people who care about privacy, usability, and long-term implications of lack of privacy are especially welcome.

This project is especially suited to contributors who value restraint, clarity, and user autonomy over rapid growth.  Let's build something we are proud of.

## Guiding Principle

Quieter.ai exists to help people use modern AI systems without surrendering
unnecessary personal data, behavioral metadata, or long-term identity.

The goal is not anonymity at all costs, but **intentional privacy**.

## Near-Term Focus

- Solidifying Quieter as a reliable, self-hostable privacy proxy for LLM usage
- Improving browser extension stability and compatibility
- Making self-hosting easier and better documented
- Providing clear, understandable privacy guarantees
- Improving observability and per-instance usage accounting

## Medium-Term Ideas

- Additional privacy-enhancing layers (scrubbing, redaction, policy-based filtering)
- Optional local-first components for sensitive workflows
- Better tools for understanding what data *would* be exposed without Quieter
- Support for additional model providers and local models
- Admin tools for multi-user or organizational deployments

## Long-Term Direction

Over time, Quieter.ai may grow into a **suite of privacy tools**, including but not limited to:

- Network-level privacy mediation for AI services
- User-facing controls over data retention and disclosure
- Tools for auditing and understanding AI data flows
- Privacy-preserving analytics and cost transparency
- Integrations that make privacy the default, not an afterthought

## How Contributors Can Help

Contributors are encouraged to:
- Improve documentation and onboarding
- Propose privacy-preserving features or designs
- Identify data leakage vectors in AI tooling
- Build experimental tools aligned with Quieter’s mission

If you’re unsure whether an idea fits, open an issue and start a conversation.

## Non-Goals (For Now)

- Providing guarantees of anonymity against targeted adversaries
- Operating as a centralized data broker
- Monetizing user data
- Replacing model providers or rehosting proprietary models

These may be revisited, but they are not current objectives.
